We are in this together. I have Covid-19, and it sucks. To be fair, it seems I have a very mild case.
My symptoms are not severe at all. I am not at all in danger, just inconvenienced. My breathing is not labored, it just feels like I'm running at 14000 feet.
My fever's have been very weak, and my dry ass cough is almost gone.
I will recover just fine, however I have a duty to my fellow coloradans to stay home for the next 10 days or so.
It would be the hight of arrogance to possibly subject other people, who may not be in as good of health, to this disease.
